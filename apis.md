description: 1,500 government websites currently use DigitalGov Search to power their
  search box. It would be impossible to match the value of GSAs DigitalGov Search
  service by procuring, building, and configuring a custom solution ourselves. With
  the combination of a very feature-rich search service and knowledgable staff, this
  is by far the best search tool ever.
